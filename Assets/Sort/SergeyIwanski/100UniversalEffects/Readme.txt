Thanks for having purchased the asset! If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact me:

This Package include 100+ effects such as fireworks, falling symbols (matrix), tesla electro, magic, sparkles, etc. 

All effects are saved in prefab. So you can use this effects easy.
Just put effect in your Scene! 
All effects are located in the folder at: SergeyIwanski > 100EffectsPack > Prefabs

There are many examples of scenes in the Scenes folder.
The _Utils folder contains a items necessary for the work of some functions of an asset, 
they are universally used in different projects and assets, therefore they are moved to a separate folder.

Some effects have a 2048x2048 spritesheet in the original to maintain quality, but you can reduce them depending on your preference.
Some effects like Tech have a common texture.

This asset contains 10 different models. They are stones of improvement - manna, health, strength of damage, run speed, stamina, etc.
You can change the color of a stone at the same time as its particle effects, simply by changing the color, bright, texture parameters in the SkillColor component.

Important: Do not use SkillColor on standard materials in Unity, otherwise it will lead to a permanent change of the material. If you, for some reason, have changed the standard material, then after reloading the editor it will return to its original state.

Note: ShowcaseScene is used only to show content, it has nothing to do with this asset, however you can use it in your projects (not for selling assets).


P.S. In the future, it is planned to improve and supplement this asset with new effects. 
Therefore, any wishes and suggestions are welcome :)
